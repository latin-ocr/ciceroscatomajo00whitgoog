Ir hasbeen the object of the Editor in this edition
of Cicero’s “ Cato Major ” and “Laelius ” to furnish a
sound Text, and to supply a body of Notes adapted
to the capacities of boys of that age at which these
treatises are usually read. At the same time he
has endeavoured to carry outa plan corresponding
to the one adopted by himin his edition of the
“ Germany’' and “ Agricola” of Tacitus-viz. to
make the work introductory to the reading of the
other, and especially the philosophical, writings of
Cicero. With this view hohas introduced into the
Notes many critical remarks of a more advanced
character, designed for pupils who have made some
progress in their studies. Occasional references
are also made to the recently published “ Public
School Latin Primer.'’
A concise analysis of each treatiseis given, as af·
l fording the readiest and most effectual means of show-
ing the writer's aim, and of explaining the method

in which he has treated his subJect.
